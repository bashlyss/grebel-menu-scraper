# Grebel Weekly Menu Scraper

This project aims to automatically create an iCalendar feed for the Conrad Grebel Weekly Menu and make this calendar available to students/associates of the college.  The bigger goal is to allow students to specify meals that they like, so they can be notified when the meal is being served.
